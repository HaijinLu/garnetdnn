# Garnet Deep Neural Network

This repo implements a web application utilizing a deep neural network to 
predict the formation energies and stability of garnet crystals.

A live version of the web application powered by Heroku is running at 
http://garnetdnn.materialsvirtuallab.org/.

# Local setup

To run the web application locally, simply type:

```bash
python app.py
```

and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 on your web browser.
